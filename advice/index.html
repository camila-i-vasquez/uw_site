         When Sara Billey at the University of Washington gave me the essay she wrote with a similar title, 
    I started thinking about things that I myself, wished I knew.  Just over a year out of my undergraduate institution and one (okay, almost two) 
    quarter into a master’s program, I am painfully aware of the things that have
     helped me and the things I missed out on. The best lessons are those we 
     learned ourselves, but there’s always a few that bear repeating.

           Math is hard. 
    The first real analysis class I took was one that I wasn’t supposed to be in. I didn’t meet the prerequisites, 
    and in the first week, I went to Dr. Whitney Berard’s office hours, 
    and confessed as much. I then asked if she thought I could handle being in 
    the class. Her response? 
    <p align ="center">
        You can definitely stay in this class. You might struggle a bit in the beginning, but just know: there’s going to be a point in
         the class where everything is hard. For everyone. That’s okay. 
    </p>
    
    It wasn’t too bad in the beginning, so I thought she was exaggerating. 
    Five weeks later I walked into her office hours and said, 
    <p align="center">
         Whitney? Remember at the start of the semester when
         you told me that the math would get hard? It’s hard now. 
    </p>
    She laughed. But then she helped me.  Because here’s the thing: math will eventually get hard. 
    And you’ll struggle. And you might be a bit sad, or maybe stressed,
    but at the end of the term, you can look back at all the things
    you’ve learned and that definition that you didn’t understand at the start
    of the term? You probably understand it way more than you did in the beginning.
    Baby steps is all you need to keep going
    And just for the record: if you still don’t get it, that’s okay.
    Get comfortable with not knowing things.

       <li>
           Learn to code. Seriously. I mean it. 
       </li>
   </ol>

    I promise you, coding is one of the most valuable skills you can learn in school, and I’m not saying this from a ‘technology is the future’ standpoint, but as a ‘you need to be able to do this thing to survive in just about any context that your math degree would be useful’. 
    So much math research is done with the help of Mathematica, with Python, with R, and so on. You can’t just get someone else to do these things, you need to be able to do them yourself. Being able to write your own (good) code helps you understand what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and can avoid the inevitable situation where you have 5 nested for- loops, 1 million data points, and your computer is overheating because you didn’t recognize that you wrote a program with n5 run-time and you just lost 4 days waiting for results that could have been done in a day if you had stopped and thought for a bit. In fact, many PhD programs allow your language requirement to be satisfied with a coding language. 
    Even if you’re not going into a PhD program, it will still be helpful, even in surprising ways. I have a friend who is a high school teacher who has written small scripts that make his life significantly easier. If you’re going to do anything involving data, you should absolutely be able to code, and yes, R counts. 
    While we’re at it, learn to code well. Practice good documentation, because in three years when that dumb script you wrote is actually useful, you’re going to wish you wrote things in a coherent manner. And two years later when you’re trying to read some other code on Github that does exactly what you need—at least you think it does? You’ll wish that person practiced writing good documentation too. Trust me. 
    3 Make your own fun 
    If you’re at a big school with a lot of resources, this bit of advice might not be as relevant. But if you’re at a small school that doesn’t have a lot of opportunities for furthering your learning or building more experience, don’t just be sad about it! Make your own opportunities. Ask about and apply to Research Experiences of Undergraduates, the NSF has a list of all the REU’s offered each year on their website [linked here]. Volunteer with math outreach programs or start an AWM chapter at your school if there isn’t one. 
    The internet has so many resources now at your disposal, numberphile, 3Blue1Brown, and my personal favorite, Vihart, are all math-centered YouTube channels, both for recreational learning and more ‘academic’ learning. MIT Open Courseware helped me fill in my missing linear algebra knowledge and is an amazing extra resource (all of the things I mentioned here are linked to their YouTube channel pages or their main website – just click on their names). 
    The school I went to was pretty small, but right next to a large university with a lot of resources. I had been discouraged from pursuing the opportunities available at the other school by my professors (more on that later), but really at the end of the day, the person who is most at fault for my lack of experience and opportunities for exposure is me. Fight for the resources and opportunities you care about. And make them happen. Just like five year olds have the best time when they make their own fun, as adults, we enjoy things more after we fought for them, and definitely get more out of it when we value it more. Make your own fun. If you have the opportunity to cross-enroll at a school, by all means, take it.

    If there’s a nearby talk that might be impossible to understand but you’re still interested in, go to it. 
    4 Professors are human. And not just in the ‘they have feelings too’ way. 
    I alluded to this in my last point, but let me start from the beginning: Professors are great. They’re people, and chances are, they care. So you can and should talk to them. Ask them about their experiences and ideas. If you’re struggling and feel comfortable telling them you absolutely should. They might have ideas to help you, and contrary to popular belief, professors are not robots, and if they’ve never been in your shoes, it’s likely that they can at least empathize with you. They might have some great insight that you missed, or they can change your life trajectory with a single comment. 
    Or, they can make suggestions that, to them, is great advice, but actually ends up hindering you. Don’t be afraid to ignore a professor’s advice if it rubs you the wrong way. Now I’m not saying to ignore everything they say, but not everything they say is law, and you are certainly not breaking the law if you don’t listen to one or two tidbits of information they throw your way. Just pick what feels right to you. This holds for everyone: advice is free; it doesn’t hurt you to take as much as you want. Just because you were given advice that doesn’t mean you need to follow it. 
    Exhibit A: this essay. 
    5 Learn how to work with others. 
    We learned it in kindergarten: sharing is caring! We learned it in high school and middle school: group projects suck. But in college? We need to find the balance between the two. Share the work, in a group. 
    Because maybe that thing that’s really easy for you is really hard for someone else, but the thing you can’t understand for the life of you is that other person’s favorite thing. Find your opposite, you’ll complement each other. 
    In my last quarter at community college, I finally started working with others. Jonathan Alvarez, David Najork and I spent way too long working through problems, wading through the textbook and definitions, and yes, arguing about what might be on the midterms. That quarter was my best academic quarter yet. And it’s 100% because of the people I got to work with. Find your Jonathan and David, the people who text you when you don’t show up to study sessions, who help you when you don’t understand applications and you help write proofs and the more abstract concepts. 
    It might take a few tries to find the people that you work well with. That’s okay! That doesn’t mean that you should give up, and just work by yourself for the rest of your life. It just means you find other people to try to work with, who complement you better. 
    6 Learn how to learn. 
    I don’t know how many people have had this experience, but I know that by the end of high school I had taken too many ‘learning style’ quizzes to count. I am a kinesthetic learner, 
    3 
    a visual learner, an auditory learner, and maybe something else? I don’t know. Honestly, I don’t really care. 
    Because I’m going to let you in on a secret: most professors aren’t going to change the way they teach and lecture just because I’m more of a kinesthetic learner. Because for every auditory learner in the room there’s a visual learner, and a musical learner, and some other learning style that I can’t think of. It doesn’t matter to me, and it shouldn’t matter to you. 
    What I care about is not the label, but the techniques that work for me. Some people love flash cards — I hate them. I rewrite things over and over again until it might as well have been on a flashcard. 
    I love color coding things — some people look at my notes and want to throw out my colored pens. 
    I need to write something down multiple times before I can even come close to remem- bering it, others just need to hear it once and it’s committed to memory. 
    Jonathan, one of my study buddies, needed to re-explain what was just explained to him, in his own words. That was great for me, because if I couldn’t explain something to him, I definitely didn’t know it either. 
    Figure out what works for you, and own it. There are a lot of people in my life who think that because they can’t learn in the way that they were expected to, school just isn’t for them, and maybe school isn’t for them. Or maybe they just haven’t figured out how they learn yet. Both possibilities are valid, but don’t just assume school isn’t for you because this one way to learn doesn’t work for you. 
    7 There is always someone better than you. 
    Take a breath, I know this might be difficult to hear. 
    As I was writing this, I thought about making a whole bunch of sports analogies to ease into the topic, but be honest with yourself, you know this. And there’s a couple of ways you can handle this: 
    1. Quit. Because you’ll never be the best, you’ll never be able to “win”, so why bother? 
    2. Live with it, embrace it, and build from there. 
    I don’t know about you, but I bet you can guess that in the “option 2” camp. And here’s why: 
    I love the freedom! I can set my own standards, walk my own path, and not worry about other people and what path they are on. 
    But that’s also not entirely what I mean, and I think you’re guessing that too. 
    What I mean is that on some days, when that proof is just not clicking, or that same person keeps answering questions in class, you might think to yourself that you’re not smart enough to ‘do math’. I know I do. And I know my peers sometimes feel that way too. Those feelings are valid and real. The math culture can be a little cutthroat sometimes and it might be tempting to throw in the towel. Don’t! Not knowing one thing doesn’t make you a bad mathematician. Not being able to answer a question doesn’t make you a bad mathematician. Taking a break doesn’t make you a — say it with me now — bad mathematician. 
    Not being the best means one thing and one thing only: 4 
    You have the room to grow and achieve more. And I think that’s a great place to be. 
    These are my thoughts, and my thoughts alone. These are the things I wish I knew the moment I decided to become a math major, and these are the lessons I have been reflecting on in my first few quarters in grad school. School can be hard. It doesn’t need to be impossible, and I know that had I learned some of these lessons sooner, school wouldn’t have felt so impossible for me at times. I invite you to make your own list. Be it for others or just for yourself, the practice of reflection is often forgotten, but sometimes reflecting can help us move forward. If you have thoughts, I’d love to hear them!
